# Brain inter-regional molecular connectivity analysis in AD

This is the official repository of the paper "*Alzheimerâ€™s disease rewires gene coexpression networks coupling different brain regions*" by Sanga Mitra (+), Kailash B P (+), Srivatsan C R, Naga Venkata Saikumar, Philge Philip and Manikandan Narayanan (+ equal contributions).

The code was developed by Manikandan Narayanan (in consultation with the other co-authors of the paper listed above), and these developers are jointly referred to as the "BIRDS Group, IIT Madras" in the preamble of all code files in this InterTissueDC project.
